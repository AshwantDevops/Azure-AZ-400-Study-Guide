# Implement Continuous Feedback (10-15%)
## Recommend and design system feedback mechanisms
- Design practices to measure end-user satisfaction (e.g., Send a Smile, app analytics)
- Design processes to capture and analyze user feedback from external sources (e.g., Twitter, Reddit, Help Desk)
- Design routing for client application crash report data (e.g., HockeyApp)
- Recommend monitoring tools and technologies
- Recommend system and feature usage tracking tools
## Implement process for routing system feedback to development teams
- Configure crash report integration for client applications
- Develop monitoring and status dashboards
- Implement routing for client application crash report data (e.g., HockeyApp)
- Implement tools to track system usage, feature usage, and flow
- Integrate and configure ticketing systems with development team's work management system (e.g., IT Service Management connector, ServiceNow Cloud Management, App Insights work items)
## Optimize feedback mechanisms
- Analyze alerts to establish a baseline
- Analyze telemetry to establish a baseline
- Perform live site reviews and capture feedback for system outages
- Perform ongoing tuning to reduce meaningless or non-actionable alerts
