# Implement Dependency Management (5-10%)
## Design a dependency management strategy
- Recommend artifact management tools and practices (Azure Artifacts, npm, maven, Nuget)
- Abstract common packages to enable sharing and reuse
- Inspect codebase to identify code dependencies that can be converted to packages
- Identify and recommend standardized package types and versions across the solution
- Refactor existing build pipelines to implement version strategy that publishes packages
## Manage security and compliance
- Inspect open source software packages for security and license compliance to align with corporate standards (e.g., GPLv3)
- Configure build pipeline to access package security and license rating (e.g., Black Duck, White Source)
- Configure secure access to package feeds
